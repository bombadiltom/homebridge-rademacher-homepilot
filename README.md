# Configuration

Configuration sample:
```
  "platforms": [
      {
        "platform": "RademacherHomePilot",
        "name": "RademacherHomePilot",
        "url": "http://192.168.0.1",
        "password": "",
        "password_hashed": false,
        "scenes_as_switch": false,
        "debug": false,
        "did_list_usage": "none",
        "did_list": []
      }
    ]
```

* `url`: address of HomePilot's web interface in your local network,
* `password`: password to HomePilot (if enabled in its web interface)
* `password_hashed`: password to HomePilot is already hashed with sha256 (if enabled in its web interface), for hashing https://www.sha-generator.de/ worked for me
* `scenes_as_switch`: if "true", all scenes are added as switch to HomeKit, otherwise scenes are not added at all 
* `debug`: if "true", debugging is activated
* `did_list_usage`: if "include" you can choose what Devices are mirrored to HomeKit, you have to enter matching DIDs below, if "exclude" you can exclude a list of DIDs, default is "none"
* `did_list`: enter the Device IDs (DIDs) you want to be shown in HomeKit. You can find them in the log file in square brackets ("[12/6/2020, 5:40:36 PM] [RademacherHomePilot] blinds are online: bodentief [10000]" => did = 10000), example list: "did_list": [10000,10001,10002]
